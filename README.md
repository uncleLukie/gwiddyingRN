hey there! so you're tired of that annoying "ad blocker detected" popup on youtube, right? this script gets rid of it and even hits play on the video for you. 🎉

## how to get this running

1. first off, get tampermonkey from [here](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php).
2. open the tampermonkey dashboard and hit "create a new script".
3. delete whatever's there and paste the script code.
4. hit save. done!

## how to make sure it's on

- the script should be on by default. if not, there's a toggle next to its name in the dashboard. flip it on.

## what's it doing, anyway?

- uses something called `MutationObserver` to keep an eye on youtube's page changes.
- finds that pesky popup by its code signature and yeets it into the void.
- hits the play button for you. you're welcome.

that's all! enjoy your youtube binge. 🍿
